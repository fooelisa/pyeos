module: eos_install_config
author: David Barroso <dbarroso@spotify.net>
version_added: "1.0.0"
short_description: Takes configuration from a file and loads it onto a device running EOS.
description: This library will take the configuration from a file and load it into a device running EOS. The old 
    configuration will be replaced by using the feature 'config replace terminal: force'. To use this module you 
    need to enable access to the device via the eAPI.

requirements:
    - pyEOS

options:
    hostname:
        description: IP or FQDN of the device you want to connect to
        required: true
    username:
        description: Username
        required: true
    password:
        description: Password
        required: true
    use_ssl:
        description: If set to true we will connect via https, if false we will use http instead. Default is true.
        required: false
    config_file:
        description: File to load the configuration from.
        required: true
    commit_changes:
        description: If set to true the commit will be performed. If set to false, we will not apply the changes, 
            only check the differences. Default: false.
        required: false
    diff_file:
        description: A file where to store the "diff" between the running configuration and the new configuration.
            If it's not set the diff between configurations is not saved. Default: none.
        required: false

EXAMPLES = '''
    In our playbook would have something like:

  tasks:
    - name: Assembling configuration
      assemble: src=compiled/{{ inventory_hostname }} dest=compiled/{{ inventory_hostname }}/running.conf

    - name: Pushing configuration to EOS
      eos_install_config:
        hostname={{ inventory_hostname }}
        username=admin
        password=p4ssw0rd
        use_ssl=false
        config_file=~/spotify/network-ansible/compiled/{{ inventory_hostname }}/running.conf
        commit_changes={{ commit_changes }}
        diff_file=logs/{{ inventory_hostname }}.log

    From the CLI we would trigger the playbook like:

        # We don't commit changes, we only want to check the diff
        $ ansible-playbook -v -e commit_changes=0 eos_test.yml

        or

        # We actually commit the changes
        $ ansible-playbook -v -e commit_changes=1 eos_test.yml
